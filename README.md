# Installation #

## Manual old fashioned way ##

Download the theme to your local directory. You can do it through `git
clone` command:

```
git clone git://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme.git
```

Then add path to gruber-darker-theme to custom-theme-load-path list â€”
add the following to your emacs config file somewhere (.emacs,
init.el, whatever):

```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path
             "/path/to/gruber-darker-theme/")
```

Use `M-x customize-themes` to change your current theme.

# Contribution #

Gruber Darker is an awesome theme. But it has a lack of support for
many good modes. I add color faces only for modes I use. If you like
this theme and use a mode that looks very bad with it, feel free to
add appropriate color faces (see file gruber-darker-theme.el) and send
me a pull request.

Thanks.
